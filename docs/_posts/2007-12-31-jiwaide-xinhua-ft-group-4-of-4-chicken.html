People are not willing to read long stories. What Jiwai.de would do is to find the essence of these fractionlets, and create value for the reader. ”<br /><br />Jiwai.de is “not only a micro-blog, but also a new media”, which allows the clients to send and receive messages through QQ, MSN, Gtalk, Skype, Wap and handset to it. “We can get any information through any devices from anyone at any places at anytime.” according to Li.<br /><br />However, just starting their business on May 20 this year, the 10-staff small company provides services totally free to only tens of thousand of clients, which is obviously not enough to make the company to dig the first barrel of gold.<br /><br />Despite Li admitted frankly that the company still has no profit, he is confident about the company’s future by saying “if the visitors reached 10,000,000, we will certainly find the model to make money”.<br /><br />Talking about his competitors, Li pointed out that Fanfou.com (also a company providing similar micro-blog service) has more clients due to the robust promotion, which his company is lack of by showing us the empty first floor of his office which assigned for marketing department with actually no staff working there.<br /><br />After the interview, Li Zhuohuan, the guy working round the clock, caught on the train to Shanghai, from where he sent out one of his gossips saying “Today is my oral English day talking to Martin for a whole afternoon with sweat streaming down my back”.
