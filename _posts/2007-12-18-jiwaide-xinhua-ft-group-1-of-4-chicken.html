Its founder, Li Zhuohuan, a Tsinghua IT graduate,  simply puts it by revealing his envisioned landscape in an awkward yet  passionately oral English, to 15 green-hand journalists led by a British  pro, whom he clearly believes to be his would-be users. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">“See, just this simply  and speedy!” Li’s eyes sparkled when he finishes a brief demonstration  of his Jiwai. The 15 Xinhua trainees are excited and inspired by his  platform partly, and apart from that, obviously more by his characters,  extra-ward, willingly, and determined. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Incorporated with current  popular chatting tools like Tencent QQ, MSN, G-talk, Skype and even  individual cell phones, Li boasts the superb convenience of Jiwai, whose  logo is a cute chicken with its mouth wide open, and its characters  meaning “gossip” in Chinese, is simply an interactive communication  platform online in which, he claims that  “every registered users  can “gossip” and indulge themselves”. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Seeing is believing.  The creation of such communication platform is fully understood and  appreciated after a face-to-face chat with Li, born in 1979, yet shares  features like highly-educated, creative and fashionable ---- typical  characters of the generation born after 80s in China.</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Positioning Jiwai determinedly  on potential young users, Li is fully aware of differentiated competitions  with his U.S. rival ---- twitters, whose participants actively contribute  resourceful and logic comments.  </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">As he acutely perceived  that, Chinese online chatting users tend to “gossip” casually, and  pick out values from “information fractions” in this info-explosive  era. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">“No body will bother  reading paragraphs of texts during casual time, they like to gossip  and enjoy, instead.”</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Despite promising outlook  of users scale, Li has to face limited funding, money burning, and striving  for profit-turning point.</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">“Me and my friend invested  on our own money, ”he smiles confidently, and funding clearly turns  out to be not a question at all to him. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">The odd is that he doesn’t  want venture capitals participation simply because he could not bear  to “give his niche to yet another with no plans in his head” -----  “That would be more confusing, isn’t it?” he sparkled with a somewhat  perceivably hidden confidence on his face. </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Li obviously has no blueprint  as for how to make his enterprise profitable, which, in his words, that  he and his stuff are striving for their prospect profit model and which  he believes could become true someday soon.</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">To what people often  relates to potential successful people ---- “somebody’s got great  gut and delicate minds”, he embodies the characters also in his arrangements  of his work place.</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">The office, a duplex  situates in a luxurious business skyscraper, is simple, tidy and in  order. The upper floor stuffed with 6 or 7 young graduates of Li’s  teens, busily researching program models in front of their PC screens. </span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;"> </span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">“My stuff here is required  to work 8 hours a day, but they normally work a 10-hour shift, and extensions  are optional,” Li says frankly at easy, “as for me, I work 24 hours  a day, &amp; days a week, simply, around the clock!” The reason, as  he puts it, “I love what I do, and I do enjoys this.”</span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Named “Zixia”, or  the purple rainbow, resembles a beauty’s title in the amusing edition  movie of “Journey to The West”, clearly amusing and humorous, Li  confesses his devotion to fashions and cutting-edge IT tools. </span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;"> </span></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">“You guys are more  than welcome to join in! Help me strengthen my users’ base!” </span><br /></div><div align="justify"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 100%;">Late in the night, Li  has scheduled to fly to Shanghai, China’s east business hub, to patricide  a conference and promote his Jiwai platform. However, hardly any second-thought  and hesitation can be perceived, but instead, a determined devotion  to the career he has always loved. Enditem.</span></div></div></div>
