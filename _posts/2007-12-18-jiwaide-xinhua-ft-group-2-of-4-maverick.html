But it is a frequent truth and amazingly these maverick students somewhat get rewarded while shaking traditional creed.<br /><br />Former Tsinghua (China’s MIT) graduate Li Zhuohuan, 28 years old, who prefers to call himself Zixia (purple rainbow) after a good-hearted female movie figure, is such a typical maverick. Graduated in 2001 from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua, Zixia has already been a hot figure on campus for his Zixia BBS.<br /><br />Calling themselves the “axe-band”, Zixia BBSers shows a close bond as a popular community even till now. The axe-band relies on the Zixia BBS so heavily that they couldn’t stand the breakdown of Zixia’s server and even contributed money for him to buy a new one not long ago.<br /><br />The saga goes on. Zixia or the maverick turned his back on his four-year major and followed his IT dreams after graduation. After working with Youku (a Chinese Youtube) as Chief Scientist for one and a half year, Zixia decided to stand on his own leg for his own “interest and happiness.”<br /><br />“Twitter, chirp, buzz, gabber, gabble, whisper, …” these are what Zixia desires his website “Jiwai.de” to be full of, after following his personal love of American Twitter.com.<br /><br />Since its establishment on May 20 this year, a symbolic day in China with a meaning of “I love you”, Jiwai.de has attracted thousands of users till now, though no profit return has yet been seen.<br /><br />“We are not quite sure about our return model, but it is for the sake of happiness when recognized by users,” said the maverick with passion.<br /><br />Daily cost of Jiwai.de includes 1,000 yuan of rent fee, payment of salaries to its 10 staff who are all fresh graduates from Beijing’s top universities, indicating that Zixia has poured at least 500,000 yuan (67,567 US dollars) till now.<br /><br />“Jiwai now is burning money, my and my friends money, but Jiwai is our dream,” said Zixia, “More than the clone of Twitter, we create Jiwai Screen, a new interactive software to facilitate Q&amp;A phase in a conference.”<br /><br />Chinese traditional education motto is challenged in front of Li Zhuohuan, but by no means Li Zhuohuan is the only student who shrugs off “good good study, day day up.”<br /><br />Uncertainties ahead are very much like shreds and fractions blogged on Jiwai.de, but wonders always spring out of uncertainties and wonders are usually created by mavericks.
